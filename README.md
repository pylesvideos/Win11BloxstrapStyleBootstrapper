# Bloxstrap Windows 11 Bootstrapper Theme
A bootstrapper theme that looks like the Windows 11 Boot screen.
Just download the code and import it into the custom theme thing

the icon is optional, it's meant to be a custom icon (you can change it in the settings)

also this has only been tested on voidstrap 🤫
